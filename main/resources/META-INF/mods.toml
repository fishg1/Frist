Encounter a frozen world, where both ruin and prosperity await. A world so cold blizzards frequently ravage the land- yet the local life has adapted, creating an ecosystem from snowy sentient snowballs to mighty chicken dinosaurs.
Underneath the icy surface lies a second ecosystem- the cavernous aquatic realm- where many deep-sea fishes varying from colorful and friendly to dark and ravenous await. Top in the cold skies are the Explorers of the World- the Tundrans, who have set sail with their regal airships.
